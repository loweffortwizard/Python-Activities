The year is 1960, while flying over the Atlantic ocean, Jake blacks out and awakens to discover that he is the sole survivor of a plane crash.

Amidst the wreckage of his plane Jack spots and swims to a lighthouse and boards a Bathysphere that takes Jake deep within the ocean and into Rapture.

Originally conceived as a utopia where a man would be entitled to all that he made without the interference of parasites by idealistic billionaire mogul Andrew Ryan. 

Rapture has since decayed and festered from the infectious effects of civil war and anarchy.

Brought about by the very ideals it citizens and its leader embrace. Aided by a sympathetic smuggler and a rogue geneticist.

Jack salvages gene altering chemicals transforming himself into a superhuman.

Jake now must use his newfound powers and abilities as well as an arsenal of weapons to fend off the vicious hordes of psychotic mutants.

As well as security robots and armored supersoldiers that resulted from Raptures unrest while given the choice to either rescue or lethally harvest the genetic material from Rapture's only citizens with a chance: the 10 year old Little Sisters. 

As Jack wanders through the condemning atmosphere of rapture, he treads towards a secret that could shatter all that he has known forever.
